# ToDo List - JavaScript

A simple todo list to train with DOM manipulating, input using, etc...

Using this todo is simple. You just need to enter your task in the input area, and click on the submit button.
Then, a list will be created with all tasks you might generate. 
You can click the checkbox to notify your task is done. Then suppress it just by clicking the red cross.
